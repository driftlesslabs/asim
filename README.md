# ActivitySim User Environment

This repository contains a user environment for ActivitySim, a tool for activity-based 
travel demand modeling. The user environment is designed to be used with the ActivitySim 
core code and provides a set of utilities and configurations to facilitate model 
development and execution.

This repository uses `uv` to manage the user environment, which allows for easy installation and
management of dependencies.
